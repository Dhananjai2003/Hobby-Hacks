# To Do Web App

This is a simple web app created using the Flask web framework in Python. The app uses HTML and CSS for the front-end interface.

## Getting Started

To run the app, first make sure you have Python and Flask installed on your system. You can install Flask using pip:

`pip install Flask`

Once Flask is installed, you can start the app by running the following command in the project directory:

`flask --app app run`

This will start the Flask development server, and the app will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.


## Usage

The app is a simple web page that allows users to perform a certain action, such as signing up for a newsletter or submitting a contact form. Modify the HTML and CSS files as needed to add new features or change the look and feel of the app.
